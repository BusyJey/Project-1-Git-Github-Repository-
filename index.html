                    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                        <p>My career goals are to get paid for what I like.
                        <br>Recently I realized UX design brings me a lot of joy. Then I took some online courses to learn more about this field. After I obtained my course certificate I decided to go further and start to work on my Associate Degree in Art Digital Media.
                        <br> So, I'm planning to keep learning web-design and front-end development.
                        <br>It appeared to be as exciting as challenging.
                        Hopefully, one day we all exhale looking at the most beautiful design of our Facebook Pages. But no one is going to know it was created by me.</p>
