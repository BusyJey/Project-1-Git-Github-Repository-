Text: I live in the Bay Area. I have worked in the Design Industry for the past 2 years. I design products across website and mobile channels, planning the user experience from the ground up. That means conducting research to align design scope, sketching initial concepts, drawing wireframes, creating prototypes, user testing, designing the visuals of the UI, and working with developers to make the design a reality.
