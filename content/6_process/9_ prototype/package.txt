Text: As the ideas evolve, it’s essential to refer back to the original problem that I’m trying to solve. Beginning with rough journey maps, user stories, and wireframes, I gradually define the fidelity of my design solutions. Since testing and validation is a big part of my process, I like to make prototypes at from low to mid levels of fidelity and interactivity to make sure I’m on the right track.
